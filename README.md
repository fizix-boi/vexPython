# vexPython

This package contains functions and other useful tools to interface with the vpython in order to more easily create and control objects for animation in the software. The name comes from a truncation of an online name that I often use that also starts with a v (similar to vpython).

Currently, there are no restrictions on use of the code. If (by some stroke of cosmic luck) use of the package is desired, please contact me for questions and/or comments on my code and updates on all the cool things you use it for.
